## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Here I was coming back to make the card better and responsive as I didn't really make it responsive the first time I submitted it. I 
also learned that I don't need to add a lot to my css when creating a media query. I'm still slightly confused my max-width and min-width, but I'll have this solution as reference.

### Continued development

Although I used flexbox to make this card, I still need to try and use css grid to make it as it should as a few solutions showed such uses. Also needing to understand media queries better.
